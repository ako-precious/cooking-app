# Terms of Service

Welcome to Mymealni! We are excited to have you join our student-run cooking platform, where home cooks connect with customers to share delicious, homemade meals. Before you begin, please read and agree to the following policy:

<h2>
1. About Mymealni </h2>
Mymealni is a student-run cooking platform that connects home cooks with customers. Our goal is to create a vibrant community where passionate cooks can share their culinary talents, and food enthusiasts can enjoy diverse and homemade meals.

<h2>
2. Food Safety and Handling </h2>
All meals prepared by our student cooks are typically made in their personal homes, which may not have been inspected by public health officials. However, we ensure that all our cooks hold a valid Food Handling Certificate, demonstrating their understanding of proper food handling and safety practices.

3. Quality Assurance </h2>
While we take steps to ensure the quality and safety of our meals, we want to transparently disclose this information to our customers. We encourage customers to rate their meals after each order, helping us maintain high standards and accountability within our community.

Please note that our platform is in its early stages, and many of our student cooks share apartments, making it challenging to meet traditional commercial kitchen inspection standards. We appreciate your understanding and support as we grow and evolve.
